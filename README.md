# Pomodoro-Timer
A pomodoro timer which works on the pomodoro technique(duh)

This is a pomodoro timer which the user can use to improve his/her productivity. The default length of the timer is 25 minuts for
work and 5 minutes for break. However, The user can customise the lengths of both work, and break.
The user can start/stop the timer by just clicking on the timer itself.
The passing of time has been visualised by the filling of the timer(like an hour glass)

I have used html, css , and angular, with a bit of jquery for this timer
